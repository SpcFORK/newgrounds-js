# Adding Newgrounds.js

for this tutorial I will use Kaboom. Don't worry, the code is intuitive and I will explain, but this is to show a real game code :)

So, this is my main code, I will load my library and Newgrounds.js using instalation guide

```html
<head>
	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/newgrounds.js@3.1.0/dist/newgrounds.js"></script>
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/kaboom/dist/kaboom.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
	kaboom() // start my game canvas
</body>
```
